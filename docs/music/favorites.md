# Favoriting Tracks

:::warning[Work in Progress]
This feature is still in beta testing and may have bugs.

You can currently only add one track to your favorites. In the future, you will be able to add multiple tracks to your favorites and pick which will show on your **Main Profile** page.
:::

## /favorite add
You can add a track to your favorites by running the `/favorite add [query]` command.

If you don't provide a query, it will add the track that is currently playing to your profile.

:::info
This also adds a section to your profile that shows your favorite track.
:::

## /favorite play
You can quickly add your favorite track to the queue by running the `/favorite play` command.

## /favorite remove
You can remove a track from your favorites by running the `/favorite remove` command.

This will remove your favorite track from your profile as well and you will no longer be able to use `/favorite play` to add it to the queue.
